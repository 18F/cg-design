# Cloud.gov initial research plan: May 2016

## Introduction

In order to best serve the needs of Cloud.gov users, we need to conduct user-centered research. For the first round of research, the design team will supplement previous competitive analysis work with user interviews of government technologists who are familiar with Cloud.gov and/or similar products such as Heroku. Based upon the results of the research, the designers will work with the developers to put together a list of a set of core features for the next iteration of the Cloud.gov console.

## Goals

To identify the needs for current and potential users of Cloud.gov.

## Tentative personas

Developers. Most concerned about security in addition to building and standing up a product.

Project managers. Most concerned about billing. Might be concerned about controlling access to orgs and spaces/apps.

## Methodology

Recruiting
-Target individuals who are potential/likely/existing users of Cloud.gov:
	-Government employees
	-Developers or PM’s
	-Experience with Heroku/similar products OR

Also maybe:
	-1 or 2 developers who are not using Cloud services.
		-What do you expect to be better using a Cloud service?
