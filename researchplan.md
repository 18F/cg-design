# Cloud.gov initial research plan: May 2016

## Introduction

In order to best serve the needs of Cloud.gov users, we need to conduct user-centered research. For the first round of research, the design team will supplement previous competitive analysis work with user interviews of government technologists who are familiar with Cloud.gov and/or similar products such as Heroku. Based upon the results of the research, the designers will work with the developers to put together a list of a set of core features for the next iteration of the Cloud.gov console.

## Goals

To identify the needs for current and potential users of Cloud.gov.

## Tentative personas

Developers. Most concerned about security in addition to building and standing up a product.

Project managers. Most concerned about billing. Might be concerned about controlling access to orgs and spaces/apps.

## Methodology

### Recruiting
_Target individuals who are potential/likely/existing users of Cloud.gov_
	- Government employees
	- Developers or PM’s
	- Experience with Heroku/similar products OR
		- (maybe move to higher level branding) Short to medium term desire to move digital services to the cloud

_For consideration: Developers who are not currently using Cloud services_
	- What do you expect to gain from moving to a Cloud service?

### Stakeholder interviews

#### A) Existing Heroku/similar developers

5-6 interviews. This user group will be our focus.
